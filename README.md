 This project is a clone of the website at http://galcon.com , implemented in Django.
 
 It's presently being hosted at http://marky1991.dyndns.org:8000.
 
 It consists of a set of apps, including chat, forums, messaging, and groups. (As well as a main project app primarily responsible for extending the user class)
 
 It is not yet complete, but nearly all functionality is already there. (At this point, HTML and CSS are all that need to be finished.)
